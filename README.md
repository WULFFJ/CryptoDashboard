# CryptoDashboard
# Dashboard utilizing the CryptoCompare website, by use of their API.
# Tons of Crypto coins on there with historical data
# This was setup for my nephew to be able to see how his coins are doing and to have the view he wanted to see them in.
# This has been pulled into Power BI for now and he can use on his app.
